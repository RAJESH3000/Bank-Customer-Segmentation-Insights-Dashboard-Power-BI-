# Bank Customer Segmentation & Insights Dashboard (Power BI)

##  Project Overview
This project, developed by **Katlagunta Rajesh**, focuses on analyzing **bank customer data (10.5 lakh+ transactions)** to uncover customer behavior, segmentation, and risk indicators.  
The solution leverages **Power BI** for data cleaning, modeling, and building interactive dashboards that deliver actionable insights.  

## Tech Stack
- **Data Source** → 10.5 lakh+ transaction records (customer demographics, account balance, transactions, credit score)  
- **Data Preprocessing** → Power Query (Data cleaning, transformations, null handling)  
- **Visualization** → Power BI (cards, bar/column charts, pie, matrix, slicers, KPIs)  

## Key Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing** → Cleaned and transformed 10.5 lakh+ rows of transaction data for consistency.  
2. **Dashboard Development** → Built interactive reports with filters, KPIs, and drill-through features.  
3. **Customer Segmentation** → Analyzed loyal, new, and lost customers with revenue and frequency metrics.  
4. **Insights Derived** →  
   - Gender, age group, and location-based customer demographics.  
   - Revenue distribution across customer segments (Loyal, New, Lost).  
   - High-risk vs. profitable customers identified via credit score analysis.  
   - Transaction patterns over time and across customer groups.
